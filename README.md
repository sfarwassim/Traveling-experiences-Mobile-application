# The Writing experience Page:
in this page, I consumed an API service that display all Venues near the user 
position Restaurants, Hotels, Bars, Gyms.
So, I displayed all the venues information (Distance from the user, category
of the venue) in a list view.
Also, I allowed the user to select one of the venues and add his experience
In it


# History Page
In this page, the user can find all the experiences that he wrote and their 
date too.
He can also delete his data or refresh it.

Finally, this is the last Page, where the user can see:
- how many posts he wrote?
- places he wrote about.
- How many times he wrote about each place?

# The Writing experience Page:
in this page, I consumed an API service that display all Venues near the user 
position Restaurants, Hotels, Bars, Gyms.
So, I displayed all the venues information (Distance from the user, category
of the venue) in a list view.
Also, I allowed the user to select one of the venues and add his experience
In it
